This Python script is designed for processing DICOM files, specifically for extracting and copying the "center slice" of representative series from TOMO (single-slice) images, under certain size constraints (100MB or less). Here's an overview of the code's purpose and functionality:

### Purpose:

The script organizes and processes DICOM files from a set of subfolders, looking for single-slice series (typically tomography images) under 100MB in size. It identifies the relevant views (LCC, RCC, LMLO, RMLO), classifies them, and then extracts one "center slice" for each of these views (if available). The selected center slices are copied into a designated output folder, ensuring that files are uniquely named and organized.

### Main Functions:

1. **View Classification**:
   The script classifies each DICOM file based on its "view" (e.g., LCC, RCC, LMLO, RMLO). It uses information such as laterality, view position, and series description to determine the appropriate classification.

2. **Slice Selection**:
   It picks the central slice from a series of DICOM files by sorting them based on their slice order and then selecting the middle slice.

3. **Unique File Handling**:
   When copying files, the script ensures that the target directory does not already contain a file with the same name. If there is a conflict, it appends a numerical suffix to make the file name unique.

4. **Recursion and Directory Traversal**:
   The script can recursively scan subdirectories to process files at any depth, depending on the user’s preference. It also skips directories that are excluded from the process.

5. **File Size Constraint**:
   The script only processes files that are under the specified size limit (default is 100MB). If a file exceeds this size, it is ignored.

6. **Output Organization**:
   The processed files are organized into output folders, each named based on the first 10 characters of the subfolder’s name. The center slices are copied with a prefix corresponding to the view (e.g., "LCC\_", "RCC\_").

### How It Works:

* **Input**: The script takes a parent folder containing multiple subfolders with DICOM files. Users can specify the maximum file size, enable deep recursion for scanning all subfolder levels, and specify an output folder for the results.
* **Processing**: It processes each subfolder, scanning for DICOM files, classifying them into views (LCC, RCC, LMLO, RMLO), and selecting the center slice from the largest series. It then copies the selected slices to the output directory.
* **Output**: After processing all subfolders, the script outputs a summary, including the number of copied files and their location.

### Key Features:

* Recursively scans subfolders for DICOM files.
* Classifies DICOM files based on view type (LCC, RCC, LMLO, RMLO).
* Extracts and copies the "center slice" from each view, if available.
* Ensures file uniqueness by renaming if a conflict occurs.
* Filters out files larger than the specified size (100MB by default).
* Provides detailed output on the processed folders and the number of copied slices.

### Typical Use Case:

This script would be useful in a medical imaging workflow where multiple DICOM files representing different views and slices of a series are stored in subdirectories. The goal is to organize and consolidate the "center slice" of key views (LCC, RCC, LMLO, RMLO) for further processing, analysis, or archiving, while ensuring that files over a certain size are excluded and the output is neatly organized.
